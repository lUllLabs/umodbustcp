UModbusTCP implements a modbus TCP master driver for Unity.

I know that exist some libraries to connect modbus TCP with your C# software. I tried some drivers like EasyModbusTCP and another paid solutions but neither of this drivers runs fine in Unity3D.

For this reason I wrote this driver that works fine in Unity3d.

You can use completely free. If this code helps you, invite me to some coffee clicking the “Donate” button in this link: http://nodlag.com/umodbustcp/ 

Thanks & enjoy.
