UModbusTCP implements a modbus TCP master driver for Unity.

Exist some libraries to connect modbus TCP with your C# software. I tryed some drivers like EasyModbusTCP and another paid solutions but neither of this drivers runs fine in Unity3D.

For this reason I wrote this driver that works fine in Unity3d.

You can use completly free. If this code helps you, consider invite me to some coffe clicking the “Donate” button in this link: http://nodlag.com/umodbustcp/
